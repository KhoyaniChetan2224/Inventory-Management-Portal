            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed">
              Our Inventory Management System was born from the need for a streamlined and intelligent way to track,
              manage, and organize inventory across businesses of all sizes. We noticed that many companies still relied on outdated tools or manual processes, leading to errors, delays, and unnecessary costs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed">
              With modern technology at our core, weâ€™ve developed a cloud-based platform that offers real-time inventory tracking,
              detailed analytics, and seamless integration with supply chain operations.
